          As a passionate caffeine addict and a graduate of METU, I am driven by
          my love for coding and problem-solving. My ultimate goal is to provide
          efficient, stylish, and accessible solutions to real-world issues. In
          addition to my coding expertise, I also enjoy creating puzzle games,
          directing short films, and cracking escape rooms. Above all, I strive
          to make a positive impact on people&apos;s lives through my work and
          hope to continue doing so.
